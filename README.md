# AI Traffic Light Controller ðŸš¦ðŸ¤–

This project implements a basic **AI-powered traffic light control system** using computer vision, Python, and socket communication. It is designed to recognize vehicle presence and dynamically adjust traffic light sequences to improve traffic flow efficiency.


## ðŸ”§ Technologies Used

- Python 3
- OpenCV
- YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection
- Socket programming (TCP)
- Raspberry Pi compatible

## ðŸš€ How It Works

1. **Object Detection:** The client uses a webcam or camera module to detect vehicles using YOLO.
2. **Socket Communication:** Sends vehicle data to the server Raspberry Pi.
3. **Traffic Light Control:**Raspberry Pi Server adjusts traffic light states based on received data.
4. **Dynamic Light Management:** Light durations change based on vehicle density.
